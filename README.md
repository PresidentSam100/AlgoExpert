All solutions files are my own original solutions.

If there are multiple solutions to a problem (Solution 1, Solution 2, ...) then the higher-numbered solution is better in terms of time/space complexity.
I personally included multiple solutions for a few problems to highlight the different approaches and the more optimal one.

Will update this and make it much more neater and organized once I solve more questions.

Will also probably add C++ and Python solutions later.
